"""Git worktree lifecycle (Phase 8 / Task 8.1).

Provides create / cleanup / merge / cleanup_all primitives used by the
worktree-isolator skill and by the autoloop driver. All git invocations go
through subprocess.run with check=True; CalledProcessError is caught and
re-raised as RuntimeError with the captured stderr to keep failure modes
explicit and observable.

Conventions
-----------
- Worktree path:  <base>/.worktrees/<workflow>-<UTC-ISO8601-minute>
- Branch name:    same basename as the worktree directory ("hm-" prefix optional;
                  the harness.yaml worktree.branch_prefix surfaces only in skill
                  prose for now — Phase 9 will adopt it here).
- Time precision: minutes (YYYYmmddTHHMMZ) — collisions inside the same minute
                  are extremely unlikely for a single-user CLI, and longer suffixes
                  hurt path readability.
