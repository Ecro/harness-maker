# /hm:res-spec-plan


## Stage: research

# Stage: research

> Atomic stage. **Exploratory** — gather facts, surface alternatives. Decisions get locked in `plan`, not here.

> Invoked as part of the **res-spec-plan** workflow.


## Communication Protocol

- Be direct and matter-of-fact. No flattery, no preamble.
- When alternatives differ in trade-offs, say which trade-off is binding.
- Distinguish facts (cite source) from inferences (label as such).
- Surface unknowns explicitly — never paper over with confident-sounding speculation.

## Purpose

Gather sufficient context before committing to a plan. Surface unknowns, prior art, library docs, and architectural alternatives so that downstream stages (`spec`, `plan`, `execute`) can proceed without rework.

**Role separation vs `/hm:plan`:**
- `research` = exploratory. Multiple approaches surface; user decides direction informally.
- `plan` = decisive. Architecture locked via formal interview + ADRs.

Research deliberately avoids heavy interaction — it is silent multi-source gathering. The deep interview belongs to `plan`. Use `--deep` here only when the topic itself is so vague that searching would produce noise.

## When to Run

- Starting a new feature in an unfamiliar area of the codebase.
- Selecting between competing approaches (libraries, patterns, algorithms).
- Investigating a bug whose root cause is unclear.
- Before writing a SPEC for a non-trivial change.

## Usage

```
/hm:research <topic> [--deep] [--slug=<name>]
```

- `<topic>` — free-form description of what to research.
- `--deep` — opt into Phase 0 refinement interview (3-5 questions to narrow scope before searching). Use when the topic is vague or over-broad. Default is OFF — research dives in directly.
- `--slug=<name>` — explicit kebab-case slug for the output file. When omitted, derive from topic (lowercase, non-alphanumeric → `-`, ≤40 chars).

## Inputs

- User topic (`$ARGUMENTS`).
- Codebase context (relevant files, prior PLANs, prior REVIEWs in `work-docs/`).
- Memory tiers — see loading order below.

## Session Context Loading

Before starting, load memory in tier order (stops at first miss per tier):

1. **Hot tier** — Read `.claude/memory/session/<today's date>.md` if it exists.
2. **Warm tier** — Skim `.claude/memory/failures.md` (first 60 lines); search relevant: `rg -F "[fail:" .claude/memory/failures.md`.
3. **Warm tier** — Skim `.claude/memory/wiki.md` (first 60 lines); search relevant: `rg -F "[wiki:" .claude/memory/wiki.md`.

## Procedure

### Phase 0 — Refinement interview (only when `--deep` is set)

Vague or over-broad topics produce shallow research. Narrowing the question first is the single highest-leverage step. Skip this phase by default; engage when the topic itself is the unknown.

When `--deep` is set, conduct one `AskUserQuestion` call in `en` with 3-5 questions drawn from this rubric:

1. **Scope narrowing** — "Is this about {sub-area A} specifically, or the broader {domain}?"
2. **Constraint surfacing** — "Which constraint actually binds: {HW budget / API compat / team skill / timeline / other}?"
3. **Pre-seed check** — "Do you have a preferred approach in mind to validate, or is this open exploration?"
4. **Success definition** — "What makes this research successful — concrete recommendation, trade-off matrix, or copyable code patterns?"
5. **Prior-art** — "Have you tried an approach that didn't work, so we can avoid it?"

Always include "Skip — proceed with topic as given" as an option. Record interview outcomes under `## Refinement Decisions` in the output document.

### Phase 1 — Multi-source gathering

Run these in parallel where the answers are independent. Total token budget ≤8k.

1. **Codebase patterns** — `Grep` / `Glob` for related identifiers, prior implementations, similar features.
2. **Prior-art search in memory** — already loaded above; pull relevant `[wiki:*]` and `[fail:*]` entries.
3. **Prior PLANs / REVIEWs** — `Grep` over `work-docs/` for related task slugs.
4. **Library / framework docs** — when the topic involves a named library (React, FastAPI, Tokio, etc.), use Context7 (or equivalent doc-fetch MCP if available) for **current** docs. Training data drifts; check official docs.
5. **Web search** — for "best practices YEAR" / "common pitfalls" / "implementation patterns" queries. Skip when an internal answer is already authoritative.
6. **Refdocs folders** — when project has `ref_folders` configured in `harness.yaml`, the `refdocs-search` skill provides lossless full-text search across registered folders.

Cite every external source. Track:
- `libs_fetched` — list of library IDs / doc URLs queried.
- `sources` — list of web URLs cited.
- `related_docs` — list of internal `[[doc-link]]` references found.

### Phase 2 — Analysis

For each surfaced approach, capture:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Approach | Short name |
| Assumption | What it presumes about the project |
| Evidence | What sources support / contradict it |
| Trade-off | Cost paid for the benefit |
| Compatibility | Fit with existing architecture |
| Risk | low / medium / high |

Then synthesize:
1. **Problem understanding** — restate the topic with sharper boundaries (in/out of scope).
2. **Recommended direction** — pick one approach with one-sentence rationale. This is *informational* — `plan` makes the binding decision.
3. **Open questions** — items that block `plan` from starting. Surface these as the validation prompt at Phase 4.
4. **Pitfalls** — what others got wrong on this topic.

### Phase 3 — Write RESEARCH document

Write to `work-docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md`. `/hm:plan` Step 2 reads this file via PLAN frontmatter `research_doc:` and skips its own retrieval — this is the single biggest token saver in the workflow.

**Required frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
type: research
task_slug: {slug}
status: complete
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
tags: [{project}, research, {tech-stack}, {2-5 domain tags}]
mtime_warn_days: 7  # downstream commands warn when this file is older than N days
libs_fetched: [{lib-ids}]
sources: [{urls}]
related_docs: [{wiki-links}]
summary: "{≤100 char one-line: recommended direction}"
---
```

**Required sections (in this order):**

1. **🎯 Recommended Direction** — TL;DR sentence + one-paragraph rationale.
2. **🔍 Refinement Decisions** — when `--deep` ran, summarize Phase 0 answers; otherwise omit.
3. **🛠️ Approaches Found** — 2-3 alternatives, each with the analysis table fields above.
4. **⚠️ Pitfalls** — concrete failure modes others hit on this topic, with citations.
5. **❓ Open Questions** — items `/hm:plan` will need to lock down via interview.
6. **📚 Sources** — bullet list of every external citation (web URLs, doc URLs, library IDs).
7. **🔗 Related Internal Docs** — `[[wiki-links]]` to prior PLANs / SESSIONS / REVIEWs found in Phase 1.

### Phase 4 — Validation

Stop and validate with the user. Surface this prompt:

```markdown
## Research saved → RESEARCH-{slug}.md

**Topic:** {topic}
**Recommended:** {Option X — one-line rationale}
**Sources fetched:** {N web} + {N library docs} + {N internal refs}
**Open questions for plan:** {N}

**Ready to proceed?** {Y/N}
- Y → run `/hm:plan {slug}` (will read RESEARCH-{slug}.md via frontmatter)
- N → tell me which approach to dig deeper into, or which open question to answer first
```

If the user opts for "dig deeper" — re-enter Phase 1 with narrowed scope (one approach in focus). Re-write the RESEARCH document; do NOT create a second file.

## Outputs

- `work-docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md` — frontmatter + 7 sections above.
- Validation summary surfaced to the user.

## Quality Bar

- No "I don't know" surprises in later stages on points covered here.
- Every claim is grounded in a cited source (internal or external) or labeled as inference.
- Open questions are explicit, not hidden as assumptions.
- The Recommended Direction is informational — never written as an architectural commitment (that's `plan`'s job).
- File is reusable: `/hm:plan` can read it without contacting the user for re-clarification on settled facts.

## Stage: spec

# Stage: spec

> Atomic stage. Acceptance-criteria specification.

> Invoked as part of the **res-spec-plan** workflow.


## Purpose

Convert a task description into testable acceptance criteria so that
implementation has an objective definition of "done" and the test stage
has something concrete to write tests against.

## When to Run

- After `research` for non-trivial features
- Before `plan` whenever the change is observable to a user, an API consumer,
  or another module
- Skipped for: docs-only changes, single-file refactors, trivial bug fixes

## Inputs

- Research notes (if `research` was run)
- User requirements / acceptance constraints
- Existing SPEC if this is an evolution of prior behaviour

## Procedure

1. Write the user-facing summary in 2-3 sentences. If it doesn't fit, the
   spec is still too broad.
2. Enumerate behaviours as numbered acceptance criteria. Each MUST be:
   - Observable (you can write a test that fails before, passes after)
   - Independent (one criterion per concern)
   - Bounded (no "etc.", no "and other related cases")
3. List explicit non-goals. What this SPEC does NOT cover.
4. Capture edge cases and error modes. Each becomes a criterion.
5. Note open questions and resolve them via AskUserQuestion before
   marking the SPEC ready.

## Outputs

- `specs/SPEC-{slug}.md` with frontmatter:
  - `type: spec`
  - `status: draft | approved`
  - `task_slug:`, `created:`, `tags:`
- Acceptance criteria numbered AC-1, AC-2, ...
- Non-goals section
- Open questions section (empty when status=approved)

## Quality Bar

- A test author can write tests directly from the criteria without guessing
- Criteria are not implementation details — they describe behaviour
- Non-goals prevent scope creep in `plan` and `execute`

## Stage: plan

# Stage: plan

> Atomic stage. Implementation planning via deep interactive interview, ADR promotion, and validator-checked phase decomposition.

> Invoked as part of the **res-spec-plan** workflow.


## Communication Protocol

- Be direct and matter-of-fact. No flattery, no preamble, no "Great question!"
- If the user's reasoning is flawed, say so immediately with specific evidence.
- Don't fold on pushback — maintain position unless new evidence is presented.
- Lead with concerns before agreement. When agreeing, explain WHY.
- Never write a plan you cannot defend at code-review time.

## Purpose

Convert acceptance criteria into a concrete sequence of implementation phases. **The deep interview is the centerpiece** — architectural decisions locked in here define how `/hm:execute` will behave. Surface ambiguity here, not in code review. A thorough interview is worth 10× the time it saves in execute.

## When to Run

- After `spec` (or after `research` when `spec` is skipped).
- Before `execute` for any change touching more than 2-3 files or introducing new architectural elements.

## Inputs

- SPEC at `specs/SPEC-{slug}.md` (when present) — drives interview skip logic.
- Research notes at `work-docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md` (when present).
- Existing TECH_SPEC.md, ADRs, prior PLANs in `work-docs/`.
- Codebase structure (modules, conventions, test layout).

## Procedure

### Step 0 — Skip heuristic (ALL 4 criteria must hold to skip the interview)

| Criterion | Skip condition |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Scope** | Single file OR config-only (typo, env var, doc copy) |
| **Architecture** | No component boundary changes, no new modules |
| **Contracts** | No API / IPC / DB schema / file format changes |
| **Risk** | Reversible in <1h with no user-facing impact |

If any criterion fails → **run the interview by default** (do not ask permission). When skipped, write a one-line justification under `## 🎙️ Interview Transcript` and proceed to Step 5.

### Step 1 — Pre-interview internal draft (NOT shown to user)

Synthesize a working plan from inputs:
- Tentative architecture (components, boundaries, data flow).
- Candidate phase decomposition.
- **Explicit list of ambiguities** ranked by blast radius (affects contracts > affects internal logic > affects naming).

This seed is what the interview refines. Investigate code unknowns with Read/Grep before treating them as ambiguities — don't outsource research to the user.

### Step 2 — SPEC inheritance check (when SPEC exists)

If `specs/SPEC-{slug}.md` exists:
1. Read it fully.
2. For each SPEC category already filled (Intent, Outcomes, In-Scope Scenarios, Non-Goals, Constraints, Verification): **do NOT re-ask** in the interview. Reference it as `✅ {category}: {summary} (from SPEC)` in the round preamble's "지금까지 확정된 것" / "decisions locked in" block.
3. Phase 0 remaining scope becomes the **how** questions (architecture / phasing / risk / trade-offs), not the **what** questions.

### Step 3 — Interview loop (unlimited rounds, user-controlled exit)

**Language rule (important):**
- **Live interview UI** → conduct in `en` (en→English, ko→Korean, ja→Japanese, others→English fallback). Round preamble, "decisions so far", open ambiguity explanations, AskUserQuestion prompts and option labels — all in `en`.
- **PLAN document on disk** → always English. Translate user's free-form answers when archiving in Step 5.

Each round runs Steps A–E.

#### Step A — Render current plan state (visualization OPTIONAL)

Visualization is NOT mandatory. Use only when it genuinely speeds comprehension. Format priority (most readable first):

1. **Prose / bullet summary** — default.
2. **Compact table** — when comparing alternatives across dimensions.
3. **ASCII boxes / arrows / trees** — when topology helps.
4. **Mermaid** — AVOID in live interview (renders as raw fenced code in terminal). OK in the final PLAN document.

Round preamble structure:

```
## Interview Round {N}

**Decisions locked in so far:**
- ✅ {Round 1 decision} (→ ADR-001)
- ✅ {Round 2 decision}

**Current plan state:**
{ASCII / bullets / table — whatever makes THIS decision easiest to see}

**Ambiguity to resolve this round:** {one specific thing}
**Why it matters:** {one-sentence impact of getting it wrong}
```

If nothing topologically changed since last round, skip the "current plan state" block.

#### Step B — AskUserQuestion (in `en`)

Constraints:
- **2-5 options per question**, each with trade-off in the label.
- **Every question includes "Other — let me describe"** as an explicit option.
- **From Round 2 onward**, include **"Plan is sufficiently clear — end interview"** on ONE foundational question per round. Not on Round 1 — require at least one substantive decision first.
- **Batch independent questions** (up to 4 per `AskUserQuestion` call). Independence test: "Would my choice of options or recommended default change based on the user's answer to another question in this batch?" If yes → separate rounds.
- **Never re-ask answered questions** — re-read prior Interview Entries before each round.
- **Never ask trivial questions** (naming conventions, file paths) — pick a defensible default and note it as an assumption.

**Question category priority** (ask in this order if multiple ambiguities remain):

1. Scope boundaries — in/out, breaking vs backward-compat
2. Architecture — component ownership, pattern choice
3. Contract shape — API signature, MQTT topic, DB schema, file format
4. Risk tolerance — staged/safe vs big-bang/fast, rollback strategy
5. Testing depth — unit / integration / manual
6. Implementation phasing — feature flag, sequence, dependencies
7. Dependencies — add library vs write own, upgrade vs pin
8. Failure handling — retry policy, circuit-break, fallback behavior
9. Observability — log level, metric names, alert thresholds

#### Step C — Record answer as Interview Entry

Append to internal transcript (written to PLAN in Step 5). Compact format (default):

```
| # | Topic | Category | Question (1 line) | Options | Choice | Note | → ADR |
```

Verbose format (when user asks for full audit trail):

```markdown
### Interview #{N} — {short topic}
**Round:** {N} | **Category:** {category} | **Promoted to ADR:** {ADR-XXX or "no"}

**Working assumptions at this point:**
- {assumption 1}

**Question asked:** {full prompt}

**Options presented:**
- A: {label} — {trade-off summary}
- B: {label} — {trade-off summary}
- Other — user-described

**User's choice:** {letter + label}
**Free-form note:** {verbatim or "—"}
**Impact on plan:** {which downstream sections this updates}
```

#### Step D — ADR promotion check

Promote the decision to a formal **Architecture Decision Record** if ANY of:
- Component boundary or ownership change.
- New or modified contract (API, IPC, schema, file format, wire protocol).
- Rejects a reasonably viable alternative.
- Long-term consequences beyond this task (sets precedent).
- Constrains future flexibility (locks in framework, library, protocol).

ADR template:

```markdown
### ADR-{NNN}: {Title}
**Status:** Accepted ({YYYY-MM-DD}, via /hm:plan interview)
**Context:** {1-2 sentences — why this decision was needed}
**Decision:** {1-2 sentences — what was chosen}
**Consequences:**
- ✅ {Positive outcome}
- ⚠️ {Trade-off accepted}
**Rejected alternatives:**
- {Option B} — Rejected because {specific reason}
**Source:** Interview #{N}
```

#### Step E — Exit check

Continue to next round UNLESS:
- User chose "Plan is sufficiently clear — end interview", OR
- Zero high/medium-impact ambiguities remain in the internal draft.

**No deferred decisions via checklist.** Before ending, scan the draft for "Accept?", "OK?", "Verify?", "Should we?", "Is this correct?" phrasings — each one is a missed round. The PLAN has no `## REVIEW CHECKLIST` section; all judgments live in the Interview Transcript or ADRs.

### Step 4 — Plan validation (`plan-validator` agent)

After the internal plan is complete (interview done, draft synthesized), invoke the `plan-validator` agent to critique it before writing to disk:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="plan-validator",
  description="Plan validator: {slug}",
  prompt="<full draft PLAN body + Interview Transcript + ADRs>\n\nReturn JSON: {overall: APPROVED|NEEDS_REVISION|MAJOR_REVISION, critiques: [...]}"
)
```

Resolution:
- **APPROVED** → write PLAN, proceed to Step 5.
- **NEEDS_REVISION** (warnings only) → run one follow-up interview round per warning. Options: A. revise plan / B. accept as risk (record in ADR) / C. reject / Other. Then write PLAN.
- **MAJOR_REVISION** (critical issues) → run follow-up rounds for each critical critique. After resolution, **re-run validator once only** (no infinite loop). If second pass still MAJOR_REVISION, ask user: A. proceed with remaining critiques as accepted-risk / B. abort planning.

Each follow-up interview answer is appended to `## 🎙️ Interview Transcript` and promoted to ADR when Step D criteria apply.

### Step 5 — Write PLAN document

Write to `work-docs/PLAN-{slug}.md` with the structure below.

**Required frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
type: plan
task_slug: {slug}
status: planning
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
tags: [{project}, plan, {tech-stack}, {2-5 domain tags}]
spec: "[[SPEC-{slug}]]"  # OR omit when no SPEC exists
research_doc: "[[RESEARCH-{slug}]]"  # OR omit when /hm:research did not run
interview_rounds: {N}
adrs: {M}
validator_outcome: APPROVED | NEEDS_REVISION_RESOLVED | MAJOR_REVISION_RESOLVED
summary: "{≤100 char one-line TL;DR}"
---
```

**Required sections (in this order):**

1. **🎯 Executive Summary** — TL;DR, What/Why, Key Decisions (linking ADRs), estimated impact
2. **📚 Prior Work** — when relevant: similar PLANs, lessons from `failures.md` / `wiki.md`, RESEARCH.md findings
3. **🎙️ Interview Transcript** — compact table (verbose only on user request) listing every round
4. **📐 Architecture Decision Records** — every promoted ADR with full template
5. **🏗️ Technical Design** — Current State / Affected Components / Dependencies / Architecture / Design Decisions (referencing ADRs) / Data Flow / API Changes
6. **📝 Implementation Plan** — numbered phases. **Each phase MUST have**:
   - Scope (files in / out)
   - Exit criterion (a runnable command or check that proves the phase is done)
   - Risk: `low` | `medium` | `high`
   - Rollback point reference (which prior phase to revert to on failure)
7. **🧪 Testing Strategy** — unit / integration / manual steps
8. **⚠️ Risks & Mitigation** — risk register table
9. **✅ Success Criteria** — checklist mirroring SPEC verification criteria when SPEC exists
10. **🔍 Plan Validation** — append validator outcome (APPROVED / consensus critiques table / resolution links to interview rounds)

### Step 6 — Verify write

After writing, Read the file back and assert:
- Starts with `---` frontmatter.
- Contains `## 🎙️ Interview Transcript` with ≥1 entry (or skip-justification line).
- ADR count in frontmatter matches `## 📐 Architecture Decision Records` heading count.
- Every phase has all 4 required fields (scope / exit / risk / rollback).

If verification fails, retry write **once**. If still failing, surface the path + error and stop — do NOT proceed to a downstream stage.

## Outputs

- `work-docs/PLAN-{slug}.md` (frontmatter + 10 sections above)
- Interview Transcript as the single source of truth for user decisions
- ADR set bound to this PLAN (numbered ADR-001…)
- `validator_outcome` recorded in frontmatter

## Quality Bar

- An independent reader can predict the file diff per phase.
- Each exit criterion is checkable (script, test, or manual checklist).
- Risks are concrete, not platitudes ("might break things").
- Every architectural decision in `## 🏗️ Technical Design` links back to an ADR or Interview Entry.
- No `Accept? / Verify? / OK?` phrasing anywhere in the PLAN — those are missed interview rounds.
- Plan validator returned APPROVED, or the resolution path is fully recorded.

## Harness Configuration [MUST FOLLOW — overrides built-in defaults]

These values come from `.claude/harness.yaml` and **must not be replaced by
model defaults**. If a value conflicts with your training-data intuition, the
harness value wins.

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `reviewers.grade_threshold` | `A` |
| `reviewers.auto_fix` | `true` |
| `reviewers.max_review_rounds` | `3` |
| `reviewers.consensus` | `cross-check` |
| `dev_mode` | `task-driven` |
| `caching` | `agent-aware` |

Re-read `.claude/harness.yaml` whenever you are unsure of the current value.

---

## Inline overrides

Extra reviewers/skills can be activated for one invocation by passing flags:

    /hm:res-spec-plan <task description> --with-reviewers=security-reviewer,performance-reviewer
    /hm:res-spec-plan <task description> --with-skills=context-linter

Recognised flags parsed from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `--with-reviewers=<csv>` — additionally activate these reviewers (must be in
  `harness.yaml`'s `reviewers.installed` list).
- `--with-skills=<csv>` — additionally activate these skills (must be in
  `harness.yaml`'s `skills.installed` list).
- `--no-auto-fix` — disable the review stage's auto-fix loop for this run
  (config default in `harness.yaml`'s `reviewers.auto_fix` is unchanged).
  Findings are still reported; no edits are applied.

Flags are additive to the harness defaults (`reviewers.enabled` /
`skills.enabled`) and apply only to this run. Unknown identifiers are warned
and ignored. The flags themselves are stripped from `$ARGUMENTS` before the
fused stages read the user's task description.
