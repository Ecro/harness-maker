# Stage: execute

> Atomic stage. TDD machine driven by PLAN. Phase A → A.5 → B → C → D, with worktree isolation and **NO commits** (wrapup owns commits).


## Communication Protocol

- Be direct. No flattery, no preamble.
- If a PLAN phase is under-specified, surface it before writing tests — don't guess.
- Don't hide test failures. Compiler/test errors go in the response verbatim.
- When Phase A.5 returns FAIL, treat the test-reviewer's reasoning as authoritative — rewrite, don't argue.

## Purpose

Apply the PLAN's phases to the codebase. When `tdd_active`, tests are written from SPEC's In-Scope Scenarios first, the implementation follows, and each PLAN phase exits only when its exit-criterion command is GREEN. Use `test_dep_map.build_test_hints()` to identify which tests are affected by each changed file — run only those tests during Phase D instead of the full suite on every edit.

## Usage

```
/hm:execute <slug> [--no-tdd]
```

- `<slug>` — task identifier matching `work-docs/PLAN-{slug}.md`. Required.
- `--no-tdd` — skip Phase A (test authoring), Phase A.5 (test-reviewer gate), and Phase B (RED gate). Phase C still loads SPEC reference. Use when:
  - Pure refactor (no behavior change — existing tests already cover).
  - Docs-only / config-only / typo fix.
  - Emergency fix where SPEC + tests are already present and correct.

  All other modes default to TDD. There is no second flag.

## Inputs

- `work-docs/PLAN-{slug}.md` (required — error if missing).
- From PLAN frontmatter:
  - `spec: "[[SPEC-{slug}]]"` → resolves to `specs/SPEC-{slug}.md`.
  - `research_doc: "[[RESEARCH-{slug}]]"` → resolves to `work-docs/RESEARCH-{slug}.md`.
- From SPEC frontmatter (when present):
  - `test_framework` (e.g., `pytest`, `gtest`, `vitest`) — Phase A writes tests against this.
  - `## 📋 In-Scope Scenarios` — drives Phase A test authoring.
  - `## ✅ Verification Criteria` — drives Phase B RED-gate command + Phase D regression check.
- Memory tiers (loaded below).

## Session Context Loading

Before any code edits, load memory in tier order (stops at first miss):

1. **Hot tier** — Read `.claude/memory/session/<today>.md` if it exists. A `checkpoint:compaction` entry means the prior session was interrupted mid-stage — check `.claude-progress.json` for partial state and resume from the last in-progress phase.
2. **Warm tier** — Skim `.claude/memory/failures.md` first 60 lines; targeted: `rg -F "[fail:" .claude/memory/failures.md` for patterns relevant to the task.
3. **Warm tier** — Skim `.claude/memory/wiki.md` first 40 lines for conventions in the implementation area.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — Worktree isolation (deterministic — do NOT rely on skill auto-discovery)

Engage isolation if `harness.yaml.worktree.scope` includes `execute`. The `worktree-isolator` skill is documentation-only — its trigger-based dispatch is probabilistic in Cursor IDE and can silently skip, leaving safety-critical edits on the main branch. **Invoke the worktree CLI directly** so isolation is deterministic across both IDEs.

**Idempotent under `/hm:loop`**: when this stage runs as part of a loop iteration, the loop has already engaged a per-loop worktree at step 5. The `worktree create` CLI detects we're already inside `.worktrees/<name>/` and returns that path — no nested worktrees, just reuse.

```bash
!uv run --with /home/noel/harness-maker/.worktrees/execute-20260508T1017Z python -m harness_maker.worktree create execute "$(pwd)"
```

Read the **single line** the command prints — that is the contract for the rest of this stage. Two cases:

- **Absolute path** like `/path/to/project/.worktrees/execute-20260506T1830Z` → isolation engaged. **Treat that exact string as `<WT>` for the rest of this stage.** You (Claude) MUST substitute the literal absolute path everywhere `<WT>` appears below — **do NOT use a shell variable**: each `!` block is a fresh subshell, so `worktree_path=...` assignment is lost between blocks.
  - Every Read/Write/Edit call uses absolute paths starting with `<WT>/`.
  - Tests / lints / type checks: `!cd <WT> && <cmd>`.
- **Empty output** → `worktree.scope` does not include `execute`. No isolation; operate in `cwd`. Skip the finalize step at end.

### Step 1 — Load PLAN + flag parsing

```bash
PLAN=work-docs/PLAN-${slug}.md
[ -f "$PLAN" ] || { echo "ERROR: PLAN not found at $PLAN — run /hm:plan ${slug} first"; exit 1; }
```

Read PLAN fully. Extract:
- Phase list with scope / exit-criterion / risk / rollback for each.
- ADRs (binding constraints — must not be violated by implementation).
- Frontmatter `spec:` and `research_doc:` references.

Parse flags from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `--no-tdd` → set `tdd_active = false`.
- Otherwise `tdd_active = true`.

### Step 2 — Resolve SPEC + RESEARCH cache (when frontmatter references them)

Per PLAN frontmatter:

```bash
spec_field=$(yq '.spec' "$PLAN")            # e.g., "[[SPEC-mqtt-retry]]"
research_field=$(yq '.research_doc' "$PLAN") # e.g., "[[RESEARCH-mqtt-retry]]"
```

If `spec:` resolves to an existing file:
- Read SPEC fully.
- Extract `test_framework` from frontmatter — Phase A uses this verbatim.
- Extract `## 📋 In-Scope Scenarios` — Phase A authors one test per scenario.
- Extract `## ✅ Verification Criteria` — Phase B RED-gate uses the named test commands.

If `research_doc:` resolves to an existing file with mtime < `mtime_warn_days` (frontmatter, default 7):
- Read it; reuse `libs_fetched`, `sources` to skip duplicate context-fetching.
- Cache HIT → no re-retrieval.

If RESEARCH file is older than `mtime_warn_days`: warn the user, proceed with implementation, but log the staleness in the PLAN's session log.

### Step 3 — Per-PLAN-phase TDD machine

For each phase in PLAN's `## 📝 Implementation Plan`, run Phases A → A.5 → B → C → D in order:

#### Phase A — Author tests (skipped when `tdd_active == false`)

For each SPEC In-Scope Scenario in scope of this PLAN phase:
1. Write test file(s) at the project's test directory using `test_framework` from SPEC.
2. Test function name encodes the scenario ID: `test_s1_<short-name>`, `test_s2_<short-name>`, etc.
3. Assertions match the scenario's `**Then**` clause exactly. No tautologies, no over-mocking, no stub-only bodies (test-reviewer enforces — Phase A.5).
4. Tests MUST be RED initially — they import / depend on functions that do not yet exist or are stubs. The implementation is written in Phase C.

#### Phase A.5 — test-reviewer gate (skipped when `tdd_active == false`)

Invoke the `test-reviewer` agent on the just-authored test files:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="test-reviewer",
  description="Phase A.5 test-quality gate: {slug}",
  prompt="<SPEC body + Phase A test file paths + test_framework name>\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON output as specified in your instructions."
)
```

Resolution:
- `overall_assessment: PASS` → proceed to Phase B.
- `overall_assessment: FAIL` → for each entry in `blocking_issues[]`, rewrite the offending test (the `passing_tests[]` list is FROZEN — do not re-author them). For each `scenarios_missing[]`, author a new test. **Re-invoke test-reviewer** until PASS. Retry budget: **2 attempts**. After 2 FAILs in a row, surface the latest verdict and stop — escalate to user.

#### Phase B — RED gate (skipped when `tdd_active == false`)

Run the test command from SPEC's `## ✅ Verification Criteria` table (or the PLAN phase's exit criterion if SPEC absent):

```bash
!cd <WT> && <test_command>
```

Expected result: tests FAIL for the right reasons (missing implementation, not syntax errors / import errors / framework misconfiguration). Verify by reading the failure output. If the test passes by accident → return to Phase A and rewrite (false-RED is a Phase A.5 escape).

#### Phase C — Implementation to GREEN

Write the implementation. No untested code paths — every public function added must be covered by a test from Phase A (or by an existing test, when `tdd_active == false`).

Constraints from PLAN's ADRs are binding: do NOT introduce a pattern that contradicts an ADR; surface as a Phase D blocker if the ADR turns out wrong.

Compile / type-check after each edit; do not batch multiple edits before checking. Include compiler / lint output in your response when surfacing progress.

#### Phase D — Post-GREEN verification

Run the project's full check suite:

```bash
!cd <WT> && <lint command>     # e.g., ruff check
!cd <WT> && <type command>     # e.g., mypy --strict
!cd <WT> && <test command>     # e.g., pytest tests/ -q
```

Plus the PLAN phase's exit-criterion command. All must pass. If any fails:
- Compile / type / lint failure → fix in Phase C (re-edit, re-check); do NOT advance.
- Test failure that wasn't there before → regression. Find the offending change, fix or revert.
- Phase exit-criterion failure → the PLAN phase is not done. Either fix or escalate.

### Step 4 — Stage exit (NO commit — wrapup owns commits)

When all PLAN phases complete GREEN:
1. Verify the worktree's working tree is clean of unintended drift (no stray edits outside scope).
2. **Leave changes staged or unstaged on the worktree branch — DO NOT run `git commit`.** Wrapup stage owns the single user-facing commit.
3. Update PLAN with phase status (in-progress / done / blocked) — but do NOT commit the PLAN file edit either.

If a PLAN phase blocks (Phase A.5 retry exhausted, Phase D unfixable, or ADR conflict):
- Document the blocker inline in the PLAN under the affected phase.
- Surface to the user with the blocker's exact failure output.
- Do NOT silently change scope.

### Step 5 — Worktree finalize

Pick **exactly one** finalize command. Substitute `<WT>` with the literal absolute path from Step 0.

```bash
# All phases GREEN — stage-merge the branch back (NO commit) + cleanup the worktree.
# /hm:wrapup will create the single user-facing commit (with proper message + Co-Authored-By).
!uv run --with /home/noel/harness-maker/.worktrees/execute-20260508T1017Z python -m harness_maker.worktree finalize <WT> stage-only
```

```bash
# Stage halted on a blocker — preserve the worktree for inspection:
!uv run --with /home/noel/harness-maker/.worktrees/execute-20260508T1017Z python -m harness_maker.worktree finalize <WT> fail
```

If Step 0 printed empty (no isolation engaged), skip both — there is nothing to finalize.

**Workflows without wrapup** (e.g., `/hm:exec-rev`): if you exit a fused workflow at this stage without wrapup running afterward, the staged changes remain uncommitted on the base branch. Either run `/hm:wrapup` to commit them, or commit manually:

```bash
git commit -m "<your message>"
```

## Outputs

- Code + tests **staged but not committed** (commit happens in `/hm:wrapup`).
- Updated PLAN with phase status (in-progress / done / blocked) — also uncommitted.
- Optional: a SESSION-{slug}.md log if the user passes `--session` (default OFF — PLAN is the primary artifact).

## Quality Bar

- All Phase D checks GREEN at stage exit, OR the blocker is documented in PLAN.
- Every SPEC In-Scope Scenario maps to a test (when `tdd_active`).
- Phase A.5 test-reviewer returned PASS (or `--no-tdd` was set).
- No diff outside the PLAN's stated scope — surprise edits are flagged.
- No `git commit` invoked from this stage. (Verify: `git log` shows no new commit relative to stage start.)
- Worktree finalized exactly once: success or fail.
