## Auto-advance check (autopilot — Claude Code only)

Before the STOP banner below, check whether this session runs under **autopilot** (live
auto-advance, ADR-005) — **Claude-Code-only**: it needs the `.hm-autopilot` marker (armed
by the picker) and the `Skill` tool. **This section is a NO-OP** — fall straight through
to the STOP banner, running nothing below — **if any of: no `Skill` tool (Cursor/Codex),
no active marker, or loop-mode is on for THIS session (a `.claude/.hm-loop-*` marker
matches `$HM_SESSION_ID`, or a legacy `.hm-loop-active` exists).**

**Step 1 — mandatory gate FIRST (absent-case = STOP).** Evaluate THIS stage's gate
*before* anything else: If any verification check FAILED, STOP.
If the gate is pending/unresolved → record it on the ledger, then **STOP** (print the
banner). Do NOT run the boundary check — a stage that stops at its gate must not record an
advance:

!uv run --with {src} hm autopilot_caps gate-blocked --root . --stage verify --session-id "$HM_SESSION_ID"

**Step 2 — boundary check (ONLY when the gate is clear).** Run the deterministic check
(it enforces the Phase-5 runaway caps + kill switch, and on proceed records the advance it
authorizes — so it must run only after Step 1 clears):

If this stage has a slug, **append** it to the command below in single quotes — e.g.
` --slug 'my-task'`. Never a shell expression or a bracketed placeholder. Omit it
otherwise; the marker keeps the earlier stage's slug.


!uv run --with {src} hm autopilot_caps boundary --root . --current verify --session-id "$HM_SESSION_ID" --step-cap 20 --time-cap-min 300

Read the JSON:
- `proceed: false` → **STOP** (print the banner) — **except `bad_slug`**. `step_cap`/
  `time_cap` = a runaway cap fired (`halted_cap` logged, marker cleared); `kill_switch` =
  autopilot off/expired; `merge_gate` = the next stage is human-gated (e.g. wrapup's
  merge/land — the marker was cleared, so invoke `/hm:wrapup` manually); `unknown_stage` =
  `--current` not in the pipeline; `pipeline_complete: true` = the pipeline finished and
  the marker was cleared.
  **`bad_slug` is yours to undo**: the `--slug` you passed is invalid; nothing was
  authorized. Do NOT print the banner — re-run with a corrected slug, or no flag.
- `proceed: true` → **auto-advance**: invoke `Skill(hm:<next_stage from the JSON>)` with
  the JSON's `task_slug` as its argument (omit when `null`), instead of the STOP banner.
  **This supersedes this stage's earlier "Stage terminal … STOP"** — that governs the
  gated path, and `proceed: true` IS the authorization it asks for. `task_slug_source:
  "persisted"` means the slug came from an earlier stage — name it before invoking, so
  another task's slug cannot advance silently.
